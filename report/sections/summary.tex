\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}
In this paper we compared the performance of feed forward and RBF neural networks on regression and classification.
For each of our six datasets we trained three feed forward networks with 0, 1, and 2 hidden layers and three RBF networks with datasets reduced using condensed nearest neighbor, k-means clustering, and partitioning around medoids.
After calculating accuracy and error for each network we were able to come to conclusions concerning the relative performance of the two network types. 
Through our results, we were able to determine that the highest performing variation of RBF network was significantly better than the highest performing variation of feed forward network in all datasets except \textit{machine}.
