\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction} The purpose of this project is to analyze feed-forward and radial basis function neural networks for classification and regression tasks. This will be done by comparing the performance of the feed-forward network with 0, 1, and 2 hidden layers and the RBF using the results of condensed nearest neighbor, k-means clustering, and k-medoids clustering as the locations for its basis functions. The performance of each will be analyzed across each of the six datasets. For classification datasets we collect the accuracy and error, while we collect mean actual error for regression sets.
